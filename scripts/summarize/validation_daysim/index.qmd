## Install Quarto

https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

## Render full Quarto book

use the `render` command at the project location to render all files
``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render
```

## To render individual Jupyter Notebooks

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render notebook.ipynb
```
Even though you are rendering only one script in the project, the entire book is still produced using previously rendered versions of the other chapters.

- Note that when rendering an `.ipynb` Quarto will not execute the cells within the notebook by default:
    - either you already executed them while editing the notebook
    - or you can execute the cells by passing the `--execute` flag to render:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render notebook.ipynb --execute
```
