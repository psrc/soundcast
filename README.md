#SoundCast: PSRC's Travel Skims to Activity Based Model#

##Background##
This code is intended to control the exchange of data between the PSRC's network model in Inro's Emme 4.0 software to our new Activity Based Model (ABM) system that is being developed in the DaySim software. DaySim requires several measures of accessibility from our network model in the form of matrices of travel times, costs, and distances. This Python code is intended to:

	+ Import estimates of personal travel by vehicle class and time of day from DaySim
	+ Estimate Truck Trips by time of day for:
		- Light Trucks
		- Medium Trucks
		- Heavy Trucks
	+ Estimate any special generators of travel not captured in DaySim for items like
		- External Stations
		- Sport's Stadiums
		- Airports
		- Convention Centers
	+ Run Highway, Transit and Non-Motorized Assignments for various vehicle classes and times of day
	+ Generate matrices of travel information related to Time, Cost and Distance for all od-pairs in our 4000 zone travel model system.

The vehicle skims include 756 matrices (12 time periods x 63 skims). Previous data exchanges between our model systems relied upon transfer via comma-separated formats.  We have implemented code that utilizes an HDF5 database as a storage container for all Emme model output.  The intent is to use hdf5 during runtime for all model processes as there are a variety of api's in various languages to access the data. For now we are assuming an HDF5 database for each time period but this might change as we move forward with implementation.

##Emme Data Structure##
To effectively utilize multiple cores on a pc for model runs, we need to have a separate Emme databank and corresponding Emme project for every time period that we wish to run in parallel.  So in order to run 12 highway assignments concurrently, we need to have 12 distinct project files with only one databank in each.

The current folder structure is:

Root Directory (for example, C:\ABM)
 -> Banks
    -> Bank1
    -> Bank2
    -> Bank3
    -> Bank4
    etc.
 -> Projects
    -> Project1
    -> Project2
    -> Project3
    -> Project4
    etc.

During code testing, we are relying on hardcoding all paths to the project files in the code.  Once testing of the code is complete, we plan to implement a refined approach to selecting the projects either through the use of a control file or possibly a tkinter based dialog selection using tkFileDialog.

##Input Files##
As of now, there are a variety of input files that exist in various ascii formats.  These files currently reside in the "Inputs" folder under each bank.  The inputs inlcude:

	1. user_classes.txt (dictionary)
		This file contains relevant data about the vehicle classes used in the skimming process. It is used to create all relevant 				matrices, link attributes and assignment and skim parameters used in the course of the run.
	2. vdfs.txt (input)
		This file contains the specification of the volume delay functions need for assignments in Emme
	3. tolls.txt (input)
		This file contains the specification of the link level tolls for the network
	4. link_calculation.txt (Emme Tool Specification)
		This file contains the specification for the link calculator tool from Emme Modeller
	5. node_calculation.txt (Emme Tool Specification)
		This file contains the specification for the node calculator tool from Emme Modeller
	6. general_attribute_based_skim.txt (Emme Tool Specification)
		This file contains the specification for Path Based Skimming of a network attribute from Emme Modeller
	7. general_generalized_cost_skim.txt (Emme Tool Specification)
		This file contains the specification for Path Based Skimming of an od object from Emme Modeller
	8. general_path_based_assignment.txt (Emme Tool Specification)
		This file contains the specification for Path Based Assignments from Emme Modeller
	9. general_path_based_volume.txt (Emme Tool Specification)
		This file contains the specification for Path Based Class Specific volumes from Emme Modeller

We are working on a solution to generalize the creation of as many of these inputs as possible.  The vdfs and tolls file could reside in our hdf5 datastore.  The Emme specifications might be auto-generated based on the inputs in the user_class dictionary.  For now, these specification files work for networks with 21 user classes.

##Time Periods##
DaySim calculates travel for all hours of the day.  In order to provide meaningful accessibility data to DaySim and still maintain reasonable model run times, the PSRC network model will be various time periods per day for various modal purposes.  The difference by mode reflects the availability of network related data b ymode and time of day.  

###Time Periods for Highway Assignments###

###Value of Time###
The values of time are currently being refined.  Originally, the value of time categories used the assignment are coming from DaySim and are:

	Class		$ per Hour		
			Cat #1	Cat #2	Cat #3
	SOV		$2.00	$8.00	$20.00
	HOV 2		$4.00	$16.00	$40.00
	HOV 3+		$6.00	$24.00	$60.00
	Trucks		$40.00	$45.00	$50.00		

	Class		minutes per cent		
			Cat #1	Cat #2	Cat #3
	SOV		0.3000	0.0750	0.0300
	HOV 2		0.1500	0.0375	0.0150
	HOV 3+		0.1000	0.0250	0.0100
	Trucks		0.0150	0.0133	0.0120


###Matrix Definition###
The code uses the Emme Tool for creating matrices to create the 84 total demand and skim matrices needed for the model run.  The code overwrites any existing matrices as DaySim will be feeding new demand each time it access Emme for skimming and the skims should change due to the new demand.  There are 21 demand trip tables and 63 total skim tables being created for auto modes (time, cost and distance).

###Vehicle Matrix Calculations###
The code creates three sets of skims for use by DaySim - travel time, generalized cost and distance.  All three skim procedures utilize the standard path based assignment analysis toolkits from Emme Modeller.  The travel time skims are created by skimming auto time (timau) across all paths, distance skims are based on link length and the generalized cost skims use the conversion of toll costs to time via values of time as noted above.
